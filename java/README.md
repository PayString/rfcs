# PayID Java Test Harness
This folder contains a Java implementation of a PayID, in addition to a
 test harness that validates the JSON test vectors.
 
NOTE that the PayID code in this project will eventually be moved to xpring4j
, but the test-harness and test-vectors will continue to live in this RFC.

## Running Tests
1. Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and a [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
1. Execute this command: `mvn clean install` in the folder holding this
 README file.
