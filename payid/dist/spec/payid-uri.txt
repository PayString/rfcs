1.  Introduction

   Various Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes enable interaction
   with, or identify resources associated with, a user account at a
   service provider.  However, no standard identifier exists to identify
   a user's payment account at a service provider.

   While popular URIs could be re-used as payment account identifiers,
   these identifiers are insufficient because they are typically
   recognized as supporting functionality unique to those schemes.  For
   example, the 'mailto' scheme [RFC6068] (which enables interaction
   with a user's email account ) is broadly deployed for messaging.  Re-
   using this identifier for payments would likely cause confusion
   because one desirable quality of a payment account identifier is that
   it expressly does not support messaging, in order to avoid spam and/
   or other security concerns such as phishing attacks.

   Deploying payment protocols on top of identifiers that are commonly
   employed for other use-cases would likely be a mis-use of those
   identifers, and could also cause confusing for end-users, among other
   problems.

   Instead, the "payid" scheme uses a new type of identifier that is
   inteneded to identify accounts for payment use-cases only.

Internet-Draft           The 'payid' URI Scheme               April 2020


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  Definition

   The syntax of the 'payid' URI scheme is defined under Section 7 of
   this document.  Although 'payid' URIs take the form "user$host", the
   scheme is designed for the purpose of identification instead of
   interaction (regarding this distinction, see Section 1.2.2 of
   [RFC3986]).  The "Internet resource" identified by a 'payid' URI is a
   user's payment account hosted at a service provider, where the
   service provider is typically associated with a DNS domain name.
   Thus, a particular 'payid' URI is formed by setting the "user"
   portion to the user's payment account name at the service provider
   and by setting the "host" portion to the DNS domain name of the
   service provider.

   Consider the case of a user with an account name of "apollo" on a
   wallet service "wallet.example.com".  It is taken as convention that
   the string "apollo$wallet.example.com" designates that payment
   account.  This is expressed as a URI using the 'payid' scheme as
   'payid:apollo$wallet.example.com'.

   A common scenario is for a user to register with a payment service
   provider using an identifier (such as an email address) that is
   associated with some other service provider.  For example, a user
   with the email address "alice@example.net" might register with a
   wallet website whose domain name is "wallet.example.com".  In order
   to facilitate payments to/from alice, the wallet service provider
   might offer alice a PayID using alice's email address.  In order to
   use her email address as the localpart of the 'payid' URI, the at-
   sign character (U+0040) needs to be percent-encoded as described in
   [RFC3986].  Thus, the resulting 'payid' URI would be
   "payid:alice%40example.net$shoppingsite.example".

   Another scenario is a payment service provider (e.g., a digital
   wallet) that allows a user to use a PayID that is associated with
   some other payment service provider.  For example, a user with the
   PayID "alice$bank.example.net" might register with a wallet website
   whose domain name is "wallet.example.net".  In order to use her
   bank's PayID as the localpart of the wallet's 'payid' URI, the
   dollar-sign character (U+0024) needs to be percent-encoded as
   described in [RFC3986].  Thus, the resulting 'payid' URI would be
   "payid:alice%24bank.example$wallet.example".

Internet-Draft           The 'payid' URI Scheme               April 2020


   It is not assumed that an entity will necessarily be able to interact
   with a user's PayID using any particular application protocol, such
   as a wallet or banking application.  To enable interactions (payments
   or otherwise), an entity would need to use the appropriate URI scheme
   for such a protocol.  While it might be true that the 'payid' URI
   minus the scheme name (e.g., "user$example.com" derived from
   "payid:user$example.com") could be paid via some application
   protocol, that fact would be purely contingent and dependent upon the
   deployment practices of the payment account provider.

   Because a 'payid' URI enables abstract identification only and not
   interaction, this specification provides no method for dereferencing
   a 'payid' URI on its own, e.g., as the value of the 'href' attribute
   of an HTML anchor element.  For example, there is no behavior
   specified in this document for a 'payid' URI used as follows:

   "<a href='payid:bob$example.com'>find out more</a> "

   Any protocol that uses 'payid' URIs is responsible for specifying how
   a 'payid' URI is employed in the context of that protocol (in
   particular, how it is dereferenced or resolved; see [RFC3986]).  As a
   concrete example, an "Account Information" application of the
   WebFinger protocol [RFC7033] might take a 'payid' URI, resolve the
   host portion to find a WebFinger server, and then pass the 'payid'
   URI as a parameter in a WebFinger HTTP request for metadata (i.e.,
   web links [RFC5988]) about the resource.  For example:

   "GET /.well-known/webfinger?resource=payid%3Abob%24example.com
   HTTP/1.1 "

   In the above example, the service retrieves the metadata associated
   with the payment account identified by that URI and then provides
   that metadata to the requesting entity in an HTTP response.

   If an application needs to compare two 'payid' URIs (e.g., for
   purposes of authentication and authorization), it MUST do so using
   case normalization and percent-encoding normalization as specified in
   Sections 6.2.2.1 and 6.2.2.2 of [RFC3986].  In addition, the
   "acctpart" is case-insensitive and therefore should be normalized to
   lowercase.  For example, the URI "PAYID:aLICE$www.EXAMPLE.com" is
   equivalent to "payid:alice$example.com".

4.  Examples

   The following example URIs illustrate several variations of PayIDs
   and their common syntax components:

        payid:alice$example.net

        payid:John.Doe$example.net

        payid:jane-doe$example.net

5.  Security Concerns

   Because the 'payid' URI scheme does not directly enable interaction
   with a user's payment account at a service provider, direct security
   concerns are minimized.

   However, a 'payid' URI does provide proof of existence of the payment
   account; this implies that harvesting published 'payid' URIs could
   prove useful for certain attackers - for example, if an attacker can
   use a 'payid' URI to leverage more information about the account
   (e.g., via WebFinger) or if they can interact with protocol- specific
   URIs (such as 'mailto' URIs) whose user@host portion is the same as
   that of the 'payid' URI (e.g., replacing the "$" character with an
   "@" sign).

   In addition, protocols that make use of 'payid' URIs are responsible
   for defining security considerations related to such usage, e.g., the
   risks involved in dereferencing a 'payid' URI, the authentication and
   authorization methods that could be used to control access to
   personal data associated with a user's payment account at a service,
   and methods for ensuring the confidentiality of such information.

   The use of percent-encoding allows a wider range of characters in
   payment account names but introduces some additional risks.
   Implementers are advised to disallow percent-encoded characters or
   sequences that would (1) result in space, null, control, or other
   characters that are otherwise forbidden, (2) allow unauthorized
   access to private data, or (3) lead to other security
   vulnerabilities.

6.  Internationalization Concerns

   As specified in [RFC3986], the 'payid' URI scheme allows any
   character from the Unicode repertoire [UNICODE] encoded as UTF-8
   [RFC3629] and then percent-encoded into valid ASCII [RFC0020].
   Before applying any percent-encoding, an application MUST ensure the
   following about the string that is used as input to the URI-
   construction process:

   o  The accountpart consists only of Unicode code points that conform
      to the PRECIS IdentifierClass specified in [RFC7564].

   o  The host consists only of Unicode code points that conform to the
      rules specified in [RFC5892].

   o  Internationalized domain name (IDN) labels are encoded as A-labels
      [RFC5890].

7.  IANA Considerations

   In accordance with the guidelines and registration procedures for new
   URI schemes [RFC4395], this section provides the information needed
   to register the 'payid' URI scheme.

   *URI Scheme Name*: payid

   *Status*: permanent

   *URI Scheme Syntax*: The 'payid' URI syntax is defined here in
   Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234], borrowing the 'host',
   'pct-encoded', 'sub-delims', and 'unreserved' rules from [RFC3986]:

     payidURI      = "payid" ":" accountpart "$" host
     accountpart   = unreserved / sub-delims
                    *( unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims )

   Note that additional rules regarding the strings that are used as
   input to construction of 'payid' URIs further limit the characters
   that can be percent-encoded; see the Encoding Considerations as well
   as Section 6 of this document.

   *URI Scheme Semantics*: The 'payid' URI scheme identifies payment
   accounts hosted at payment service providers.  It is used only for
   identification, not interaction.  A protocol that employs the 'payid'
   URI scheme is responsible for specifying how a 'payid' URI is
   dereferenced in the context of that protocol.  There is no media type
   associated with the 'payid' URI scheme.

   *Encoding Considerations*: See Section 6 of this document.

   *Applications/Protocols That Use This URI Scheme Name*: At the time
   of this writing, only the WebFinger protocol uses the 'payid' URI
   scheme.  However, use is not restricted to the WebFinger protocol,
   and the scheme might be considered for use in other protocols.

   *Interoperability Considerations*: There are no known
   interoperability concerns related to use of the 'payid' URI scheme.

   *Security Considerations*: See Section 5 of this document.
