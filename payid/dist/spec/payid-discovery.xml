<t>This specification defines the PayID Discovery protocol, which can be used
to discover information about a 'payid' URI using standard HTTP methods.</t>

<t>The primary use-case of this protocol is to define how to transform a 
PayID URI into a URL that can be used with other protocols.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>PayID Discovery is used to transform a PayID URI <xref target="PAYID-URI"></xref> into a
   URL (defined below as a PayID Discovery URL) that can then be used by 
   higher-order protocols to discover metadata about a PayID-enabled service
   provider.</t>

<t>This document specifies two modes of PayID discovery: one using
   Webfinger <xref target="RFC7033"></xref> to resolve a corresponding PayID Discovery URL
   from a PayID using an interactive protocol. The second mode uses a manual 
   mechanism to assemble a PayID Discovery URL from a PayID by-hand.</t>

<t>In 'interactive' mode, a PayID can be presented to a Webfinger-enabled 
   service endpoint that supports PayID Discovery. The resource returns a
   Webfinger-compliant JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) <xref target="RFC4627"></xref> object 
   that can be used to perform PayID Discovery as defined in section 4.1 of
   this document.</t>

<t>As an alternative, "manual" mode MAY be used to decompose a PayID into a
   URL, without any intermediate server interaction by simply transposing
   portions of a PayID URI into a URL format. This procedure is defined in
   section 4.2 of this document.</t>

<t>It should be noted that "manual" mode does not allow divergence between the
   string characters in a PayID URI and any corresponding PayID URL. 
   Interactive mode, on the other hand, does allow such divergence, and is 
   thus more powerful. For example, in manual mode, the PayID
   'alice$example.com' MUST always map to the URL 
   'https://example.com/alice', whereas in interactive mode that same
   PayID URI can map to any arbitrary URL structure determined by the
   service provider, such as 'https://example.com/users/alice'.</t>

<t>Information returned via PayID Discovery might be used for direct human
   consumption (e.g., looking up someone's Bitcoin address), or it might be
   used by systems to help carry out some operation (e.g., facilitating,
   with additional security mechanisms, protocols to support compliance or 
   other legal requirements necessary to facilitate a payment).</t>

<t>The information returned via this protocol is intended to be static
   in nature. As such, PayID Discovery is not intended to be used to return
   dynamic information like a payment account balance or the current
   status of a payment account.</t>

<t>PayID Discovery is designed to be used across many applications. Use of 
   PayID Discovery is illustrated in the examples in Section 3 and
   described more formally in Section 4.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="example-usage" title="Example Usage">
<t>This section shows sample uses of PayID Discovery in several
   hypothetical scenarios.</t>

<section anchor="payid-discovery-by-a-wallet" title="PayID Discovery by a Wallet">
<t>Suppose Alice wishes to send a friend some XRP from a web-based wallet
   provider that Alice has an account on. Alice would log-in to the wallet
   provider and enter Bob's PayID (say, <spanx style="verb">bob$receiver.example.com</spanx>) into the
   wallet UI to start the payment.</t>

<t>The Wallet application would first perform a WebFinger query looking for 
   the PayID Discovery service provider, like this:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
 GET /.well-known/webfinger?
       resource=payid%3Abob%24receiver.example.com
       HTTP/1.1
 Host: receiver.example.com
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The server might respond like this:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
 Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
 Content-Type: application/jrd+json

 {
   "subject" : "payid:bob$receiver.exmaple.com",
   "links" :
   [
     {  
       "rel": "http://payid.org/rel/payid-uri-template/1.0",
       "template": "https://receiver.exmaple.com/users/{acctpart}"
     }
   ]
 }
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Alice's wallet then uses the URL template found in the <spanx style="verb">template</spanx> property
   to assemble the specified PayId URL, 
   <spanx style="verb">https://receiver.exmaple.com/users/bob</spanx>.</t>

<t>Per <xref target="RFC7033"></xref>, Webfinger requests can be filtered by using a "rel" 
   parameter in the Webfinger request. Because support for the "rel" parameter
   is not required nor guaranteed, the client must not assume the "links" 
   array will contain only the link relations related to PayID Discovery.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="payid-discovery-with-default-template" title="PayID Discovery with Default Template">
<t>Suppose Alice, as in the example above, wishes to send a friend some XRP
  from a web-based wallet provider that Alice has an account on. However, in 
  this example, let's assume that the PayID Alice is wanting to pay doesn't 
  support "interactive" PayID discovery (i.e., the receiver's server doesn't 
  support Webfinger).</t>

<t>Alice would log-in to her wallet provider and enter Bob's PayID (say
  <spanx style="verb">bob$receiver.example.com</spanx>) to make a payment.</t>

<t>The Wallet application would first attempt a WebFinger query as in the 
  example above, like this:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  GET /.well-known/webfinger?
        resource=payid%3Abob%24receiver.example.com&
        HTTP/1.1
  Host: receiver.example.com
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>However, in this case the <spanx style="verb">receiver.example.com</spanx> server doesn't support 
  "interactive" PayID Discovery, so the server responds like this:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Because Alice's Wallet can utilize "manual" PayID Discovery, the wallet
  software merely transforms <spanx style="verb">bob$receiever.example.com</spanx> into the URL 
  <spanx style="verb">https://receiver.example.com/bob</spanx>. Alice's wallet then uses that URL to 
  continue making a PayID payment.</t>

<t>It should be noted that "manual" mode does not allow the PayID URI to
  diverge from the underlying URL returned via PayID Discovery. Because of
  this, "interactive" PayID Discovery is generally preferred.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="payid-discovery-protocol" title="PayID Discovery Protocol">
<t>The PayID Discovery protocol is used to request information about an entity
  identified by a PayID URI.</t>

<t>When successful, PayID Discovery always yields a PayID URL, which is a
  URI as defined by <xref target="RFC3986"></xref> using the 'https' scheme defined in section
  2.7.2 <xref target="RFC7230"></xref>. A PayID URL can be used for any purposes outside the
  scope of this document.</t>

<t>PayID Discovery is performed using one of two modes: "interactive" or
  "manual." Clients MUST attempt "interactive" mode first. If that
  mode fails to yield a PayID URL, then "manual" mode MAY be used as an
  alternative discovery mechanism.</t>

<section anchor="interactive-mode" title="Interactive Mode">
<t>Interactive PayID Discovery is broken up into a series of steps, each of
  which is defined in more detail below. The following is a visual
  representation of the protocol flow:</t>

<section anchor="step-1-assemble-payid-discovery-url" title="Step 1: Assemble PayID Discovery URL">
<t>PayID Discovery utilizes the Webfinger <xref target="RFC7033"></xref> specification in a 
  narrowly defined profile.</t>

<t>This document defines a PayID Discovery URL as being a Webfinger 
  resource URI where the specified resource value is a valid PayID 
  URI <xref target="PAYID-URI"></xref>.</t>

<t>For example, the PayID Discovery URI for alice$example.com is</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
 https://example.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource=payid%3Abob%24example.com
]]></artwork></figure>

</section>
<section anchor="step-2-query-payid-discovery-url" title="Step 2: Query PayID Discovery URL">
<t>A Webfinger query MUST be performed against the PayID Disovery URL,
  as described in section 4.2 of Webfinger.</t>

<t>In response, the WebFinger resource returns a JSON Resource Descriptor (JRD)
  as the resource representation to convey information about the requested 
  PayID.</t>

<t>If the Webfinger endpoint returns a non-200 HTTP response status code, then
  interactive PayID Discovery is considered to have failed. Clients MAY 
  attempt to assemble a PayID URL using "manual" mode as defined in section
  4.2.1 of this document.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="step-3-parse-payid-metadata" title="Step 3: Parse PayID Metadata">
<t>If the PayID Discovery server returns a valid response, the response will
  contain one or more of the JRDs defined in section 5 of this document.</t>

<t>If any of the JRDs contain a 'rel' value that represents a PayID URL
  Template, then that template value MUST be used in the next protocol step.</t>

<t>Failing the above, if the 'rel' value of any JRDs represents a PayID
  Discovery URL, then that URL MUST be used in step 2 above, repeated
  recursively if needed, until a valid PayID URI Template is obtained. 
  That URI Template value MUST be used in the next protocol step.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="step-4-assemble-payid-url" title="Step 4: Assemble PayID URL">
<t>A PayID URL is constructed by applying the PayID URI to the PayID URI
   Template string obtained in the step above. The PayID URI template MAY
   contain a URI string without any variables to represent a host-level
   PayID URL that is identical for every PayID URI on a particular host.</t>

<t>For example, a PayID Discovery endpoint that only supports a single account
   might use a URI template string with no variables, like this:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
{
  "rel": "https://payid.org/ns/payid-uri-template/1.0",
  "template": "https://example.com/alice"
}
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The result of this step is the PayID URL. Once obtained, PayID Discovery
   is considered to have completed successfully.</t>

<section anchor="template-syntax" title="Template Syntax">
<t>This specification defines a simple template syntax for PayID URI
   transformation.  A template is a string containing brace-enclosed
   ("{}") variable names marking the parts of the string that are to be
   substituted by the corresponding variable values.</t>

<t>This specification defines a one variable – "acctpart" – which 
   corresponds to the 'acctpart' of a PayID URI as defined in <xref target="PAYID-URI"></xref>.</t>

<t>When substituting the 'acctpart' value into a URI 'path' as defined by
   <xref target="RFC3986"></xref>, values MUST NOT be percent or otherwise encoded because the
   'acctpart' value of a PayID URI always conforms to the character set
   allowed by paths in <xref target="RFC3986"></xref>.</t>

<t>However, before substituting template variables into a URI 'query' part,
   values MUST be encoded using UTF-8, and any character other than
   unreserved (as defined by <xref target="RFC3986"></xref>) MUST be percent-encoded per <xref target="RFC3986"></xref>.</t>

<t>Protocols MAY define additional variables and syntax rules, but MUST NOT 
   change the meaning of the 'acctpart' variable. If a client is unable to
   successfully process a template (e.g., unknown variable names, unknown or 
   incompatible syntax), the JRD SHOULD be ignored.</t>

<t>The template syntax ABNF is as follows:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
uri-char     =  ( reserved / unreserved / pct-encoded )
var-char     =  ALPHA / DIGIT / "." / "_"
var-name     =  %x61.63.63.74.70.61.72.74 / ( 1*var-char ) ; "acctpart" or
                                                              other names
variable     =  "{" var-name "}"
PAYID-URI-Template =  *( uri-char / variable )
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>For example:</t>

 Input:    alice$example.org
 Template: https://example.org/{acctpart}
 Output:   https://example.org/alice
