    <abstract>


<t>This specification defines one of the extensions of the Basic PayID protocol <xref target="PAYID-PROTOCOL"></xref> that aims to enable trust-minimized PayID service. Specifically, this extension of Basic PayID protocol eliminates the trust requirement between the PayID owner and their PayID service provider by allowing PayID server operators (such as wallets/exchanges) to send payment account(s) address information associated with a PayID <xref target="PAYID-URI"></xref> that is digitally signed with the PayID private key of the PayID owner along with PayID owner's <spanx style="verb">identity</spanx> information and other meta-data needed to verify the signature.  As a result, Self-Sovereign Verifiable PayID enables PayID service providers to match the security model of applications such as non-custodial digital wallets.</t>

<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
<t>This protocol can be referred to as <spanx style="verb">Self-Sovereign Verifiable PayID</spanx>. It uses the following terminology.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Endpoint: either the client or the server of a connection.</t>
  <t>Sender: individual or entity originating a transaction.</t>
  <t>PayID client: the endpoint that initiates PayID protocol/sending side of the transaction.</t>
  <t>PayID server: the endpoint that returns payment account(s) address information in response to a PayID protocol request (non-custodial wallets, exchanges, etc).</t>
  <t>PayID owner: individual or entity receiving a transaction.</t>
  <t>Digital Signature: As defined in <xref target="RFC4949"></xref>.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"></xref> and [RFC9174][].</t>

</section>
<section anchor="motivation" title="Motivation">

<t>While Self-Sovereign Verifiable PayID can be used in any context, its most immediate use case is to enable non-custodial service providers to provide hosted PayID service while preserving the existing trust assumptions between themselves and their users.</t>

<t>Providers of PayID-enabled payment services can be broadly categorized as custodial and non-custodial, each of which operate under different security models. Non-custodial wallets/exchanges do not store their customers’ on-ledger private keys on their servers. Instead, these customers hold their private keys and hence are in full control of their funds. As such, there is no trust requirement between non-custodial wallets/exchanges and their customers, and these services are not responsible for any for lost, compromised or stolen private keys of their customers. Likewise, customers of non-custodial wallets/exchanges do not need to worry if the servers of those wallets/exchanges are compromised.</t>

<t>Basic PayID protocol <xref target="PAYID-PROTOCOL"></xref> specifies a protocol to interact with a PayID server and retrieve a payment account(s) address information resource along with other meta-data corresponding to the queried PayID. One of the security assumptions made by the basic PayID protocol that may be less desirable for some applications is that the owner of the PayID must trust their PayID server to provide correct and untampered responses. Under this model, the PayID server has full control over the contents of any PayID response message, with potentially adverse effects if the server goes rogue or is compromised. The PayID owner has no way of knowing if the PayID server behaves maliciously. This implicit trust assumption between the PayID owner and their PayID server is often unacceptable in a non-custodial setting.</t>

<t>Self-Sovereign Verifiable PayID protocol allows a PayID owner to digitally sign a PayID response using a local application/device with their PayID private key (which never leaves their device). This signed PayID response can then be securely transferred to the non-custodial PayID service provider's server who can then send this as a response to a PayID query along with PayID owner's "identity" information. PayID clients can use this information to verify if a PayID response is signed by the PayID owner and then decide whether to proceed with any particular transaction.  Consequently, the trust between a PayID owner and their PayID server to serve the correct mappings is removed.</t>

<section anchor="self-sovereign-verifiable-payid-protocol-specification" title="Self-Sovereign Verifiable PayID Protocol Specification">
<t>The Self-Sovereign Verifiable PayID protocol is designed along the same design principles as <xref target="PAYID-PROTOCOL"></xref>.</t>

<section anchor="paymentinformation-resource-as-json-web-signatures" title="PaymentInformation Resource as JSON Web Signatures">
<t>The PayID Protocol <xref target="PAYID-PROTOCOL"></xref> defines a Payment Account(s) Information Resource that contains information about a particular PayID. This document further refines this definition to allow this information to be digitally signed, and then represented as a JSON Web Signature (JWS) <xref target="RFC7515"></xref> using JWS JSON Serialization.</t>

<t>Below, this document further defines the structure of each JWS component, for the purposes of Self-Sovereign Verifiable PayID protocol.</t>

<section anchor="jose-protected-header" title="JOSE Protected Header">
<t>For JWS, the members of the JSON object represented by the JOSE Header describe the cryptographic operations applied to the JWS Protected header and the JWS payload and optionally additional properties of the JWS.</t>

<t>For a complete list of members of this object, refer to <xref target="RFC7515"></xref>. Following is a decoded JSON payload representing an example of JOSE protected header parameters as defined by the JWS JSON Serialization syntax.</t>

<t>In the above example, the <spanx style="verb">PaymentInformation</spanx> resource is a pre-signed message with the PayID private keys of the PayID owner Bob. Bob's non-custodial wallet retrieves this response and sends it to the PayID client.</t>

<t>This security considerations section only considers PayID clients and servers bound to implementations as defined in this document.</t>

<t>The security guarantees mentioned in <xref target="PAYID-PROTOCOL"></xref> apply to this protocol. In this section, we discuss the security model for Self-Sovereign Verifiable PayID protocol for non-custodial service providers.</t>

<section anchor="security-model-for-non-custodial-payid-service-providers" title="Security Model for Non-Custodial PayID Service Providers">

<t>In the current security model, non-custodial wallets do not store their customers’ keys.  Instead, wallet customers hold their private keys on their own device(s). There is a no trust requirement between the service provided by a non-custodial wallets and its customers. Because customers in this scenario hold the private keys:
  * Wallets are not liable for any consequences coming from the loss, compromise or theft of customers' private keys.
  * The non-custodial wallets do not require their customers to trust their servers in case wallets servers go malicious or are compromised.</t>

<t>This extension of Basic PayID protocol preserves this trust model. Rather than requiring the PayID server to provide accurate PayID response for their customers, the PayID owners can generate these signed mappings with their own PayID private key locally on their app/device. The sender of the payment (PayID client wallet’s customer) can easily verify these signatures out-of-band with the receiver (i.e., PayID owner). This eliminates any risk of the non-custodial PayID server wallet losing its private keys, going malicious, getting hacked, or becoming otherwise compromised in a way that customers might lose funds.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="using-json-web-signatures" title="Using JSON Web Signatures">
<t>The implementations of this extension of Basic PayID protocol MUST refer to the Security Considerations sections of <xref target="RFC7515"></xref> and <xref target="RFC7519"></xref>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="using-addresses-array" title="Using addresses Array">
<t>The <spanx style="verb">addresses</spanx> array in the PayID response is an array of unsigned payment addresses. Implementations of this extension of Basic PayID that choose to populate this array along with the <spanx style="verb">verifiedAddresses</spanx> array MAY be vulnerable to downgrade attacks. We RECOMMEND against populating this array unless absolutely necessary depending on the use-case.
Also, note that this approach is not backwards-compatible with the PayID clients that do not understand Self-Sovereign Verifiable PayID protocol.</t>

<section anchor="privacy-considerations" title="Privacy Considerations">
<t>All privacy guarantees in the Privacy Considerations section of <xref target="PAYID-PROTOCOL"></xref> apply to this extension of Basic PayID protocol.</t>
