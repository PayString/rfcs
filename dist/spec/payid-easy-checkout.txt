1.  Terminology

   This protocol can be referred to as the "PayId Easy Checkout
   Protocol".  It uses the following terminology: * PayID client: a
   client that queries a PayID server using the PayID Protocol as
   defined in [PAYID-PROTOCOL][].  * PayID server: the endpoint that
   returns payment account(s) information, which conforms to the PayID
   Protocol.  * merchant: individual or entity receiving the payment (ie

   e-commerce merchant, charity).  * customer: individual or entity
   originating the payment to the "merchant".  * wallet: the holder of
   funds for the "sender" (may or may not be custodied).  * Redirect
   URL: The URL that is the result of the PayID Easy Checkout protocol,
   and which can be used to redirect a client to a wallet corresponding
   to a particular PayID.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119] and [RFC9174][].

2.  Introduction

   The PayID Easy Checkout Protocol is a minimal protocol designed to
   provide a set of standard APIs and flows, which can be used to send
   payments between two entities in a way that requires: * minimal
   effort for the user initiating the transaction.  * no server-side
   software specific to PayID or its protocols for servicing the
   transaction.  * only UI-based solutions.

2.1.  Motivation

   The PayID Easy Checkout Protocol aims to enable a consistent user
   experience for customers paying for goods in an e-commerce by
   standardizing the interaction between merchants and customer wallets.
   Given the ability to assign arbitrary metadata to a PayID as defined
   in [PAYID-DISCOVERY], there is an opportunity to standardize the set
   of interactions between merchant and customer, specifically the
   process by which a merchant directs a customer to their digital
   wallet to complete a payment.  We believe this protocol will enable
   an improved paying experience by reducing the number of steps a
   customer must take to complete a transaction and creating a
   consistent and familiar checkout pattern for customers.

   The second priority of PayID Easy Checkout is to limit the
   engineering effort needed to implement the protocol.  Clients wishing
   to adopt this pattern should only need to implement UI-level changes
   in order to make the flow function as intended, which may aid in
   expanding overall adoption, further enhancing the protocol's user
   experience benefits.

2.2.  Design Goals

Internet-Draft   Draft 1 - PayID Easy Checkout Protocol        July 2020


2.2.1.  Minimal effort for the customer

   In order for a customer to checkout using the PayID Easy Checkout
   protocol, the customer only needs to provide a merchant with their
   PayID Easy Checkout enabled PayID.

2.2.2.  No server-side software not already covered by the PayID
        Protocol

   Because the flow of PayID Easy Checkout is predicated on using the
   PayID Discovery Protocol and then redirecting the customer away from
   the merchant, all of the flow can be instrumented on the front end
   and doesn't require server-side resources.

   Apart from a PayID Discovery compliant PayID Server, The PayID Easy
   Checkout Protocol does not require server-side software to be run by
   either the customer or merchant for a payment.  The PayID server is
   capable of providing details of where to send the customer via the
   PayID Discovery Protocol.  Assuming the wallet used by the customer
   has implemented support in their UI for the PayID Easy Checkout
   Protocol, the customer can be redirected to their wallet to complete
   their transaction.

3.  Example Usage

   This section shows a non-normative example of PayID Easy Checkout
   between a hypothetical merchant and customer.  The merchant accepts
   payments using the PayID pay$merchant.com, and the customer controls
   the PayID alice$wallet.com.

3.1.  PayID Easy Checkout Initiation

   In this example, the customer might place some items in an online
   shopping cart on the merchant's UI, then choose to checkout.  The
   merchant UI would then render a form asking for the customer's PayID,
   as well as a "Checkout with PayID" button.  Once the customer inputs
   their PayID alice$wallet.com and clicks the "Checkout with PayID"
   button, the merchant UI begins the PayID Easy Checkout flow.

3.2.  PayID Easy Checkout Wallet Discovery

   The merchant UI would first assemble the PayID Discovery URL as
   defined in section 4.1.1 of [PAYID-DISCOVERY], yielding the URL
   "https://wallet.com/.well-known/
   webfinger?resource=payid%3Aalice%24wallet.com".  The merchant UI
   would then query the assembled URL as defined in section 4.1.2 of
   [PAYID-DISCOVERY].

Internet-Draft   Draft 1 - PayID Easy Checkout Protocol        July 2020


   The HTTP request in this example would look like this:

   GET /.well-known/webfinger?resource=payid%3Aalice%24wallet.com
   Host: wallet.com

   If the customer's PayID server has enabled PayID Easy Checkout in
   their wallet, the server would respond with something like this:

 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
 Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
 Content-Type: application/jrd+json

 {
   "subject" : "payid:alice$wallet.com",
   "links" :
   [
     {
       "rel": "https://payid.org/ns/payid-easy-checkout/1.0",
       "template": "https://wallet.com/checkout?amount={amount}&receiverPayId={receiverPayId}&currency={currency}&nextUrl={nextUrl}"
     }
   ]
 }

3.3.  Expand Wallet Discovery URL Template

   The merchant UI would parse the PayID Discovery response and iterate
   over the "links" collection to find the link with the Relation Type
   of "https://payid.org/ns/payid-easy-checkout/1.0".  The UI can then
   do a search and replace on the "template" field value in the link,
   replacing all occurrences of the predefined query parameter template
   names with the values they want to send to the customer's wallet.
   One query parameter of note is the "nextUrl" parameter, which allows
   the merchant to supply a redirect or callback URL for the sender's
   wallet to call once the customer has confirmed the payment.  In this
   example, the merchant would like to display a "Thank You" page, and
   replaces "{nextUrl}" with "https://merchant.com/thankyou".

3.4.  Redirect Customer to Their Wallet

   Once the merchant UI populates the required query parameters in the
   URL template, the merchant UI redirects the customer to the Redirect
   URL so that the customer can confirm the payment.

3.5.  Customer Confirms Payment

   After the customer clicks the "Pay with PayID" button the merchant's
   UI, and the merchant performs the previous steps, the customer will
   be redirected to the Redirect URL, which is a front end resource of

Internet-Draft   Draft 1 - PayID Easy Checkout Protocol        July 2020


   the wallet.  The wallet UI can read the query parameters from the
   Redirect URL and render a confirmation page or modal with all of the
   required fields pre-populated.

   Once the customer confirms the payment, the wallet would perform a
   PayID address lookup on the "receiverPayId" query parameter to get
   the payment address of the merchant and submit a transaction to the
   underlying ledger or payment system.  The merchant can then redirect
   the user back to the URL specified in the "nextUrl" query parameter,
   which will display the "Thank You" page of the merchant.

4.  PayID Easy Checkout Protocol

   The PayID Easy Checkout Protocol can be used to facilitate an end-to-
   end checkout flow for users transacting with an e-commerce entity.

   The protocol is comprised of two parts: 1) PayID Easy Checkout
   Discovery 2) Checkout flow and auxiliary e-commerce logic.

   While PayID Easy Checkout Discovery and the general user flow must be
   standardized to create a uniform API across all participants the
   manner by which e-commerce entities and digital wallets handle
   specific parts of the flow, along with individual entities' business
   logic around checkout, is out of scope for this RFC.  However, this
   paper will recommend best practices for building PayID Easy Checkout
   flows.

4.1.  PayID Easy Checkout Discovery

   The primary benefit of an e-commerce entity using the PayID Easy
   Checkout Protocol is its ability to automatically redirect customers
   to their digital wallet to complete the checkout process.  If
   merchants and payment processors were instead forced to create one-
   off integrations with each wallet, implementing this functionality
   would quickly become an untenable undertaking.  On the other side of
   the protocol, individual wallets will likely want to maintain control
   over resource locations on their individual domains.

   In order to meet the technical needs of both wallets and e-commerce
   receivers, PayID Easy Checkout extends [PAYID-DISCOVERY] by defining
   a new Link Relation type in the PayID metadata returned by a PayID
   Discovery query.

   E-commerce receivers who wish to perform Easy Checkout MUST query the
   PayID Discovery server to obtain a PayID Easy Checkout URL.  Digital
   wallets who wish to enable Easy Checkout for their users MUST host a
   PayID Discovery server and MUST respond to PayID Discovery queries
   with an Easy Checkout URL.

Internet-Draft   Draft 1 - PayID Easy Checkout Protocol        July 2020


   E-commerce receivers SHOULD implement fallback measures to complete
   checkout if a user's wallet does not support PayID Easy Checkout.

4.1.1.  Assemble PayID Easy Checkout Discovery URL

   The process of assembling a PayID Discovery URL is defined in section
   4.1.1 of [PAYID-DISCOVERY].

4.1.2.  Step 2: Query PayID Discovery URL

   A Webfinger query MUST be performed against the PayID Easy Checkout
   Discovery URL, as described in section 4.2 of Webfinger.

   In response, the WebFinger resource returns a JSON Resource
   Descriptor (JRD) as the resource representation to convey information
   about the requested PayID.

   If the Webfinger endpoint returns a non-200 HTTP response status
   code, or if the resulting JRD does not contain a link with a PayID
   Easy Checkout URL Template, then PayID Easy Checkout is considered to
   have failed.  Clients SHOULD implement fallback measures to complete
   checkout in this case.

4.1.3.  Parse PayID Easy Checkout Metadata

   If a wallet supports PayID Easy Checkout, the PayID server MUST
   respond with a HTTP status code 200 and a JSON payload containing a
   JSON Resource Descriptor (JRD) as defined in section 5.2 of
   [PAYID-DISCOVERY].  Along with any other PayID Metadata, the PayID
   server's response MUST contain a Link Relation conforming to the Link
   Relation definition in the (TODO: link to section) section of this
   paper.

   For example, a PayID server might respond to a PayID Easy Checkout
   discovery query with the following payload:

 {
    "subject": "payid:alice$wallet.com",
    "links": [
        {
            "rel" : "https://payid.org/ns/payid-easy-checkout/1.0",
            "template": "https://wallet.com/checkout?amount={amount}&receiverPayId={receiverPayId}&currency={currency}&nextUrl={nextUrl}"
        }
    ]
 }

   The e-commerce receiver must parse this response, and find a link
   whose "rel" field has a value of "https://payid.org/ns/payid-easy-



Kramer & Simpson        Expires January 14, 2021                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft   Draft 1 - PayID Easy Checkout Protocol        July 2020


   checkout/1.0".  Any link with this relation MUST have a corresponding
   URI template, as defined in (TODO: link to template syntax) the
   Template Syntax section of this document.

4.1.4.  Assembling PayID Easy Checkout URL

   The PayID Easy Checkout URL is constructed by applying various
   values, determined by the receiver, to the PayID Easy Checkout URI
   template found in the previous step.

   The PayID Checkout URI template MAY not contain the complete set of
   variables specified in section (TODO link section) of this document.
   However, PayID Easy Checkout clients MUST replace each variable
   instance with a value.  It is RECOMMENDED that PayID Easy Checkout
   clients have values available for every variable defined, in the case
   that the PayID Easy Checkout URI Template contains the complete set
   of specified variables.

   The result of replacing all template variables in the PayID Easy
   Checkout URI Template with values is a PayID Easy Checkout URL.  Once
   obtained, PayID Easy Checkout Discovery is considered to have
   completed successfully.

4.1.5.  Template Syntax

   TODO: Update this for PayID Easy Checkout URI Template

   This specification defines a simple template syntax for PayID Easy
   Checkout URI transformation.  A template is a string containing
   brace-enclosed ("{}") variable names marking the parts of the string
   that are to be substituted by the corresponding variable values.

   This specification defines several variables, MAY or MAY NOT be
   present in every PayID Easy Checkout URI Template.  These variables
   are as follows:

'amount': The amount that should be sent by the sender to the receiver
'receiverPayID': The PayID URI of the receiver
'currency': The currency that the sender should send (TODO: define currency enum or use rfc)
'network': The network that the sender should send payment over (TODO: define network enum or use rfc)
'nextURL': A URL that the sender's wallet can use after completing the payment

   When substituting values into a URI 'path' or 'query' part as defined
   by [RFC3986][], values with characters outside the character set
   allows by paths or query parameters in [RFC3986][], respectively,
   MUST be percent or otherwise encoded.

Internet-Draft   Draft 1 - PayID Easy Checkout Protocol        July 2020


   Protocols MAY define additional variables and syntax rules, but MUST
   NOT change the meaning of the variables specified in this document.
   If a client is unable to successfully process a template (e.g.,
   unknown variable names, unknown or incompatible syntax), the JRD
   SHOULD be ignored.

   The template syntax ABNF is as follows:

   uri-char     =  ( reserved / unreserved / pct-encoded )
   var-char     =  ALPHA / DIGIT / "." / "_"
   var-name     =  %x61.63.63.74.70.61.72.74 / ( 1*var-char )
   variable     =  "{" var-name "}"
   PAYID-URI-Template =  *( uri-char / variable )

   For example:

Input:    alice$wallet.com
          amount = 10
          receiverPayID=pay$merchant.com
          currency=XRP
          network=XRPL
          nextUrl=https://merchant.com/thankyou
Template: https://wallet.com/checkout?amount={amount}&receiverPayId={receiverPayID}&currency={currency}&network={network}&nextUrl={nextURL}
Output:   https://wallet.com/checkout?amount=10&receiverPayId=payid%2Apay%24merchant.com&currency=XRP&network=XRPL&nextUrl=https://merchant.com/thankyou
