    <abstract>


<t>This specification defines one of the extensions of the verifiable PayID protocol <xref target="VER-PAYID-PROTOCOL"></xref> that aims to enable trust minimized PayID service that has applications in non-custodial settings. More specifically this extension of verifiable PayID protocol eliminates the trust requirement between the PayID owner and their PayID service provider by allowing the non-custodial PayID service providers (wallets and exchanges) to send payment account(s) address information associated with a PayID <xref target="PAYID-URI"></xref> that is digitally signed with the PayID private key of the PayID owner along with PayID owner's <spanx style="verb">identity</spanx> information and other meta-data needed to verify the signature.</t>

<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
<t>This protocol can be referred to as the <spanx style="verb">Verifiable PayID Protocol Extension for Non-Custodial Services</spanx>. It uses the following terminology.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Endpoint: either the client or the server of the connection.</t>
  <t>Sender: individual or entity originating the transaction.</t>
  <t>PayID client: the endpoint that initiates PayID protocol/sending side of the transaction.</t>
  <t>PayID server: the endpoint that returns payment account(s) information/receiving side of the transaction (non-custodial wallets, exchanges, etc).</t>
  <t>PayID owner: individual or entity receiving the transaction/owner of the PayID<xref target="PAYID-URI"></xref>.</t>
  <t>Digital Signture: As defined in <xref target="RFC4949"></xref>.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"></xref> and [RFC9174][].</t>

</section>
<section anchor="motivation" title="Motivation">

<t>We anticipate that the most common use-case for retrieving the payment account(s) address information is to make transactions. Providers of such services can be categorized as custodial and non-custodial each of which operate under different security models. Non-custodial wallets and exchanges do not store their customers’ on-ledger private keys on their servers. The customers hold their private keys locally on their device and hence are in full control of their funds. As such, there is no trust requirement between the non-custodial wallets and exchanges and their customers. Additionally, since the customers hold the private keys so the wallets are not liable for any consequences coming from the lost, compromised or hacked private keys of the customers. Nor do they need their customers to trust their servers in case wallet's servers go malicious or are compromised.</t>

<t>Basic PayID protocol <xref target="PAYID-PROTOCOL"></xref> specifies a protocol to interact with a PayID server and retrieve a payment account(s) information resource along with other meta-data corresponding to the queried PayID. One of the assumptions in the security model of the basic PayID protocol that is less desirable is the trust requirement between the PayID owner and their PayID server to provide correct payment account(s) address information resource. As such, PayID server has full control over the contents of the response message, and may go rogue or be compromised. The PayID owner has no way of knowing if the PayID server behaves maliciously. This implicit trust assumption between the PayID owner and PayID server is not ideal in the non-custodial settings.</t>

<t>The motivation for this extension of verifiable PayID protocol is to enable non-custodial service providers to provide non-custodial PayID service while preserving their existing security model. More specifically, this extension allows PayID owners to digitally sign the payment account(s) information resource locally on their application/device with their PayID private key (which never leaves their device). This signed payment account(s) information resource can then be securely transferred to the non-custodial PayID service providers' servers who can then send this to the PayID client in response to a PayID query along with PayID owner's <spanx style="verb">identity</spanx> information. The PayID client and/or the sender of the transaction can use this information to verify if the payment account(s) address information is signed by the PayID owner and decide if they want to proceed with the transaction.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="verifiable-payid-protocol-extension-specification" title="Verifiable PayID Protocol Extension Specification">
<t>The Verifiable PayID protocol is designed along the same design principles as <xref target="PAYID-PROTOCOL"></xref>.</t>

<section anchor="paymentinformation-resource-as-json-web-signatures" title="PaymentInformation Resource as JSON Web Signatures">
<t>We describe the payment accounts(s) information resource per <xref target="PAYID-PROTOCOL"></xref> that is digitally signed as <spanx style="verb">PaymentInformation</spanx> resource represented as a signed JSON Web Tokens (JWT) <xref target="RFC7519"></xref> known as JSON Web Signature (JWS) <xref target="RFC7515"></xref>. JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. JWTs encode claims as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JWS structure enabling the claims to be digitally signed. Below we define the three components of JWS.</t>

<section anchor="jose-protected-header" title="JOSE Protected Header">
<t>For JWS, the members of the JSON object represented by the JOSE Header describe the cryptographic operations applied to the JWS Protected header and the JWS payload and optionally additional properties of the JWS.</t>

<t>For a complete list of members of this object, refer to <xref target="RFC7519"></xref> and <xref target="RFC7515"></xref>. Following is an example of a JWT object representing JOSE header parameters for JWS JSON Serialization syntax.</t>

<section anchor="alg" title="alg">
<t>The "alg" (algorithm) Header Parameter identifies the cryptographic algorithm used to secure the JWS. This is a required field as described in <xref target="RFC7515"></xref>. We RECOMMEND using "ES256K" which is Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) using secp256k1 curve-type and SHA-256 hash-type as defined in IANA JSON Web Signature and Encryption Header Parameters Registry.</t>

<section anchor="b64" title="b64">
<t>The "b64" (base64url-encode) Header Parameter is an extension to JWS specification that determines how payload is represented in the JWS and the JWS signing input.

<t>The "jwk" (JSON Web Key) Header Parameter represents the public key that is used to digitally sign the JOSE header and JWS payload. This parameter is represented as a JSON Web Key as specified in <xref target="RFC7517"></xref>. In the header above, members of "jwk" represent the properties of the public key, including its value that corresponds to the algorithm "ES256K".</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>kty: The "kty" (key type) parameter identifies the cryptographic algorithm family used with the key, such as "EC" for Elliptic Curve.</t>
  <t>use: The "use" (public key use) parameter identifies the intended use of the public key such as "sig" for signature.</t>
  <t>crv : The "crv" (Curve) parameter represents the elliptic curve-type and the hash-type such as "secp256k1" represents curve-type <spanx style="verb">secp256k1</spanx> and the hash-type <spanx style="verb">SHA-256</spanx>.</t>
  <t>x : Since we assume the "alg" parameter as "ES256K" which is one from the ECDSA family, so "x" parameter represents the X-coordinate of the corresponding public key.</t>
  <t>y : Since we assume the "alg" parameter as "ES256K" which is one from the ECDSA family, so "y" parameter represents the Y-coordinate of the corresponding public key.</t>

<t>In the above example, the <spanx style="verb">PaymentInformation</spanx> resource is a pre-signed message with the PayID private keys of the PayID owner Bob. Bob's non-custodial wallet retrieves this response and sends it to the PayID client.</t>

<t>This security considerations section only considers verifiable PayID clients and servers bound to implementations as defined in this document.</t>

<t>The security guarantees mentioned in <xref target="PAYID-PROTOCOL"></xref> applies to this extension of verifiable PayID protocol. In this section, we discuss a security model for the Verifiable PayID protocol for non-custodial service providers.</t>

<section anchor="security-model-for-non-custodial-payid-service-providers" title="Security Model for Non-Custodial PayID Service Providers">

<t>In the current security model, non-custodial wallets do not store their customers’ keys on their servers. The customers hold their private keys on their device. There is a no trust requirement between the service provided by the non-custodial wallets and the customers of this service. Since the customers hold the private keys:
  * The wallets are not liable for any consequences coming from the lost, compromised or hacked private keys of the customers.
  * The non-custodial wallets do not require their customers to trust their servers in case wallets servers go malicious or are compromised.</t>

<t>This extension of verifiable PayID protocol preserves this trust model. Consequently, a non-custodial wallet running a PayID server has no liability for providing accurate <spanx style="verb">PaymentInformation</spanx> for their customers that is signed with the private key of the non-custodial PayID server wallet. Instead, the PayID owners can generate these signed mappings with their own PayID private key locally on their app/device. The sender of the payment (PayID client wallet’s customer) can easily verify these signatures based on the trust relationship between the sender and the receiver (PayID owner). This eliminates any risk of the non-custodial PayID server wallet losing its private keys, going malicious, getting hacked, or becoming otherwise compromised in a way that customers might lose funds.</t>

<section anchor="using-jwts" title="Using JWTs">
<t>The implementations of this extension of Verifiable PayID protocol MUST refer to the Security Considerations sections of <xref target="RFC7515"></xref> and</t>

</section>
<section anchor="using-addresses-array" title="Using addresses Array">
<t>The <spanx style="verb">addresses</spanx> array in the <spanx style="verb">PaymentInformation</spanx> response is an array of unsigned payment addresses. Implementations of this extension of verifiable PayID that choose to populate this array along with the <spanx style="verb">verifiedAddresses</spanx> array MAY be vulnerable to downgrade attacks. We RECOMMEND against populating this array unless absolutely necessary depending on the use-case.
ALso, note that this approach is not backwards-compatible with the PayID clients that do not understand verifiable PayID.</t>
