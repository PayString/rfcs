    <abstract>


<t>This specification defines the PayID protocol - an application-layer protocol, which can be used to interact with a PayID-enabled service provider. The primary use case is to discover payment account information along with optional metadata identified by a PayID <xref target="PAYID-URI"></xref>. The protocol is based on HTTP transfer of PayID protocol messages over a secure transport.</t>

<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
<t>This protocol can be referred to as the <spanx style="verb">Basic PayID Protocol</spanx> or <spanx style="verb">PayID Protocol</spanx>. The following terminology is used by this specification.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Endpoint: either the client or the server of the connection.
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>Sending Endpoint: sending side of the transaction (wallet or exchange).</t>
      <t>Receiving Endpoint: receiving side of the transaction (wallet or exchange).</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>PayID client: The endpoint that initiates the PayID protocol.</t>
  <t>PayID owner: The owner of the PayID URI as described in <xref target="PAYID-URI"></xref>.</t>
  <t>PayID server: The endpoint that returns payment account information.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t><xref target="PAYID-URI"></xref> describes a URI scheme to identify payment account(s) at a service provider. <xref target="PAYID-DISCOVERY"></xref>, on the other hand, defines how to transform a PayID URI into a PayID URL that can be used by other protocols to interact with a PayID-enabled service provider but does not define the protocol(s) to do so.</t>

<t>This document specifies the PayID protocol - an application-layer protocol which can be used to interact with a PayID-enabled service provider identified by a PayID URL using standard HTTP methods over a secure transport. In its most basic mode, a PayID protocol resource returns a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object representing the payment account(s) information along with optional metadata corresponding to the queried PayID URI <xref target="PAYID-URI"></xref>. The protocol defines new media formatting types for requests and responses, but uses normal HTTP content negotiation mechanisms for selecting alternatives that the PayID client and server may prefer in anticipation of serving different use cases.</t>

<section anchor="design-goals" title="Design Goals">

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Extensibility</t>
</list></t>

<t>Although the primary use case for the payment account(s) information resource returned via the Basic PayID protocol is assumed to be for making payments, the PayID protocol is designed to be easily extensible to facilitate creation and retrieval of other resources about the PayID owner, PayID client and/or PayID server that might be required for making payments.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Neutrality: Currency and Network Agnostic</t>
</list></t>

<t>The PayID protocol is designed to be a fundamentally neutral protocol. The PayID protocol is capable of returning a PayID owner's payment account(s) information for any network that they (or their service) can support. This makes the PayID protocol a network and currency agnostic protocol, capable of enabling payments in BTC, XRP, ERC-20 tokens, Lightning, ILP, or even fiat networks like ACH.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Decentralized &amp; Peer-to-Peer</t>
</list></t>

<t>Just like email servers, anyone can run their own PayID server or use third-party hosted services. If self-hosted, the PayID protocol introduces no new counterparty risk or changes to a service’s security or privacy model. PayID protocol doesn’t require new, complex, and potentially unreliable peer discovery protocols, instead establishing direct peer-to-peer connections between communicating parties from the start.
   PayID is built on the most successful decentralized network: the web. There is no designated centralized authority, or a risk of a patchwork of different standards in different jurisdictions that make a global solution impossibly complex.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Service Sovereignty</t>
</list></t>

<t>Each service provider that uses PayID for their users maintains full control of its PayID URL space and PayID service, and has the ability to incorporate any policies they choose, including privacy, authentication, and security.  They also have full sovereignty over users on their domain, just like with email. PayID is highly generalized and does not prescribe any particular solution outside of the standardized communication, which makes it compatible with existing compliance and user management tools and philosophies.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="payid-server-discovery" title="PayID Server Discovery">
<t>To support PayID protocol, the PayID client needs to discover the PayID URL corresponding to the PayID URI <xref target="PAYID-URI"></xref>. This can be obtained either by using mechanisms described in <xref target="PAYID-DISCOVERY"></xref> or by manually entering the PayID URL.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="json-format-design" title="JSON Format Design">
<t>JSON, as described in [RFC8259][], defines a test format for serializing structured data. Objects are serialized as an unordered collection of name/value pairs. JSON does not define any semantics around the name/value pairs that make up an object. PayID protocol's JSON format defines name/value pairs that annotate a JSON object, property or array for PayID protocol resources.</t>

<t>The PayID client MUST request a PayID response in JSON format through the <spanx style="verb">Accept</spanx> header with the media type as defined below, optionally followed by format parameters. One of the optional parameters is the case-insensitive <spanx style="verb">q</spanx> value as described in Section 5.3.1 of <xref target="RFC7231"></xref> to indicate relative preference.</t>

<t>Each message body is represented as a single JSON object. This object contains a name/value pair whose value is the correct representation for a primitive value as described in [RFC8259][], or an array or object as described in the section below.</t>

<t>If the PayID server does not support JSON format, it MUST reply with an appropriate error response.</t>

<t>This section shows sample use of Basic PayID protocol in several hypothetical scenarios.</t>

<section anchor="basic-payid-protocol-by-a-wallet" title="Basic PayID Protocol by a Wallet">
<t>Suppose Alice wishes to send a friend some XRP from a web-based wallet provider that Alice has an account on. Alice would log-in to the wallet provider and enter Bob's PayID (say, <spanx style="verb">bob$receiver.example.com</spanx>) into the wallet UI to start the payment.
   The Wallet application would first discover the PayID URL for the PayID service-provider using one of the mechanisms described in PayID discovery <xref target="PAYID-DISCOVERY"></xref> protocol.</t>

<t>The Wallet application would then issue an HTTPS GET request:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
 GET /users/bob HTTP/1.1
 Host: www.receiver.example.com
 Accept: application/payid+json
 PayID-version: 1.0
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The PayID server might respond like this:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
 Content-Type: application/json
 Content-Length: 403
 PayID-version: 1.0
 Cache-Control: max-age=0
 Server: Apache/1.3.11
 {
   "payId" : "bob$receiver.example.com",
   "addresses" :
   [
     {  
       "paymentNetwork" : "xrpl",
       "environment" : "testnet",
       "addressDetailsType" : "CryptoAddressDetails",
       "addressDetails" : {
                    "address" : "XTVQWr6BhgBLW2jbFyqqufgq8T9eN7KresB684ZSHKQ3oDth"
            }
      },
     {

       "environment" : "mainnet",
       "addressDetailsType" : "ACHAddressDetails",
       "addressDetails" : {
                    "accountNumber" : "5674536253",
                    "routingNumber" : "aYJTDFGLKAJD"
            }
      }
    ],
    "memo" : "Additional optional Information"
 }
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>In the above example we see that the PayID server returned a list of payment accounts identified by PayID <spanx style="verb">bob$receiver.example.com</spanx>. This is because Alice's Wallet asked for all the payment accounts corresponding to the PayID in the <spanx style="verb">Accept</spanx> header.
  Alice's Wallet MAY then use the payment account information to make payments.</t>

<t>Another example:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
 GET /users/bob HTTP/1.1
 Host: www.receiver.example.com
 Accept: application/xrpl-testnet+json; q=0.4,
         application/ach+json; q=0.1
 PayID-version= 1.0
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The PayID server might respond like this:</t>

<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">
<t>This security considerations section only considers PayID clients and servers bound to implementations as defined in this document. Such implementations have the following characteristics:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>PayID URIs are static and well-known to the PayID client; PayID server URLs can be static or discovered.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The following are considered out-of-scope:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Communication between the PayID owner and the wallet or exchange (which acts as PayID server) for PayID URI registration, etc.</t>
  <t>Communication between the sender of the transaction and the PayID client to transfer information such as PayID URI and other transaction details, etc.</t>
  <t>PayID server URL discovery by the PayID client. Implementations using PayID-Discovery <xref target="PAYID-DISCOVERY"></xref> MUST consider the security considerations in the corresponding document.</t>
  <t>PayID server URL resolution by the PayID client. Implementations using DNS, DNSSEC, DoH, DoT, etc. MUST consider the security considerations of the corresponding documents.</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="network-attacks" title="Network Attacks">
<t>Basic PayID protocol's security model assumes the following network attackers:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Off-path attacker: An off-path attacker can be anywhere on the network. She can inject and spoof packets but can not observe, or tamper with the legitimate traffic between the PayID client and the server.</t>
  <t>On-path attacker: An on-path attacker can eavesdrop, inject, spoof and replay packets, but can not drop, delay or tamper with the legitimate traffic.</t>
  <t>In-path or Man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacker: An MiTM is the most powerful network attacker. An MiTM has full access to the communication path between the PayID client and the server. She can observe, modify, delay and drop network packets.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Additionally we assume that the attacker has enough resources to mount an attack but can not break the security guarantees provided by the cryptographic primitives of the underlying secure transport.</t>

<t>The basic PayID protocol runs over HTTPS and thus relies on the security of the underlying transport. Implementations utilizing TLS 1.3 benefit from the TLS security profile defined in <xref target="RFC8446"></xref> against all the above network attackers.</t>

<section anchor="denial-of-service-dos-attacks" title="Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks">
<t>As such, cryptography can not defend against DoS attacks because any attacker can stop/interrupt the PayID protocol by:
  * Dropping network packets,
  * Exhaustion of resources either at the network level or at PayID client and/or server.</t>

<t>The PayID servers are recommended to follow general best network configuration practices to defend against such attacks <xref target="RFC4732"></xref>.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="information-integrity" title="Information Integrity">
<t>The HTTPS connection provides transport security for the interaction between PayID client and server but does not provide the response integrity of the data provided by PayID server. A PayID client has no way of knowing if data provided in the payment account information resource has been manipulated at the PayID server, either due to malicious behavior on the part of the PayID server administrator or as a result of being compromised by an attacker. As with any information service available on the Internet, PayID clients should be wary of the information received from untrusted sources.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="privacy-considerations" title="Privacy Considerations">
<t>The PayID client and server should be aware that placing information on the Internet means that any one can access that information. While PayID protocol is an extremely useful tool to discovering payment account(s) information corresponding to a human-rememberable PayID URI, PayID owners should also understand the associated privacy risks. The easy access to payment account information via PayID protocol was a design goal of the protocol, not a limitation.</t>

<section anchor="access-control" title="Access Control">
<t>PayID protocol MUST NOT be used to provide payment account(s) information corresponding to a PayID URI unless providing that data via PayID protocol by the relevant PayID server was explicitly authorized by the PayID owner. If a PayID owner wishes to limit access to information, PayID servers MAY provide an interface by which PayID owners can select which information is exposed through the PayID server interface. For example, PayID servers MAY allow PayID owners to mark certain data as <spanx style="verb">public</spanx> and then utilize that marking as a means of determining what information to expose via PayID protocol. The PayID servers MAY also allow PayID owners to provide a whitelist of users who are authorized to access the specific information. In such a case, the PayID server MUST authenticate the PayID client.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="payment-address-rotation" title="Payment Address Rotation">
<t>The power of PayID protocol comes from providing a single place where others can find payment account(s) information corresponding to a PayID URI, but PayID owners should be aware of how easily payment account information that one might publish can be used in unintended ways. As one example, one might query a PayID server only to see if a given PayID URI is valid and if so, get the list of associated payment account information. If the PayID server uses the same payment address each time, it becomes easy for a third-party to track one's entire payment history. The PayID server MUST follow the best practice of payment address rotation for every query to mitigate this privacy concern.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="on-the-wire" title="On the Wire">
<t>PayID protocol over HTTPS encrypts the traffic and requires mutual authentication of the PayID client and the PayID server. This mitigates both passive surveillance <xref target="RFC7258"></xref> and the active attacks that attempt to divert PayID protocol queries to rogue servers.</t>

<t>Additionally, the use of the HTTPS default port 443 and the ability
  to mix PayID protocol traffic with other HTTPS traffic on the same connection can deter unprivileged on-path devices from interfering with PayID operations and make PayID traffic analysis more difficult.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="in-the-payid-server" title="In the PayID Server">
<t>The Basic PayID protocol data contains no information about the PayID client; however, various transports of PayID queries and responses do provide data that can be used to correlate requests. A Basic PayID protocol implementation is built on IP, TCP, TLS and HTTP. Each layer contains one or more common features that can be used to correlate queries to the same identity.</t>

<t>At the IP level, the PayID client address provides obvious correlation information. This can be mitigated by use of NAT, proxy, VPN, or simple address rotation over time. It may be aggravated  by use of a PayID server that can correlate real-time addressing information with other identifiers, such as when PayID server and other services are operated by the same entity.</t>

<t>PayID client implementations that use one TCP connection for multiple PayID requests directly group those requests. Long-lived connections have better performance behaviours than short-lived connections; however they group more requests, which can expose more information to correlation and consolidation. TCP-based solutions may also seek performance through the use of TCP Fast Open <xref target="RFC7413"></xref>. The cookies used in TCP Fast open may allow PayID servers to correlate TLS connections together.</t>

<t>TCP-based implementations often achieve better handshake performance through the use of some form of session resumption mechanism, such as Section 2.2 of <xref target="RFC8446"></xref>. Session resumption creates a trivial mechanism for a server to correlate TLS connections together.</t>

<t>HTTP's feature set can also be used for identification and tracking in a number of ways. For example, Authentication request header fields explicitly identify profiles in use and HTTP cookies are designed as an explicit state-tracking mechanism and are often used as an authentication mechanism.</t>

<t>Additionally, the <spanx style="verb">User-Agent</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">Accept-Language</spanx> request header fields often convey specific information about the PayID client version or locale. This allows for content-negotiation and operational work-arounds for implementation bugs. Request header fields that control caching can expose state information about a subset of the client's history. Mixing PayID queries with other HTTP requests on the same connection also provides an opportunity for richer data correlation.</t>

<t>The PayID protocol design allows implementations to fully leverage the HTTP ecosystem, including features that are not enumerated in this document. Utilizing the full set of HTTP features enables PayID to be more than HTTP tunnel, but it is at the cost of opening up implementations to the full set of privacy considerations of HTTP.</t>

<t>Implementations of PayID clients and servers need to consider the benefits and privacy impacts of these features, and their deployment context, when deciding whether or not to enable them. Implementations are advised to expose the minimal set of data needed to achieve the desired feature set.</t>

<t>Determining whether or not PayID client implementation requires HTTP cookie <xref target="RFC6265"></xref> support is particularly important because HTTP cookies are the primary state tracking mechanism in HTTP, HTTP cookies SHOULD NOT be accepted by PayID clients unless they are explicitly required by a use case.</t>

<t>Overall, the PayID protocol does not introduce significant additional privacy concerns beyond those associated with using the underlying IP, TCP, TLS and HTTP layers.</t>
